"""Hit and Run Models of Bax and Bak Activation by PUMA, BIM, tBid, and p53"""

# PUMA, tBid, and BIM directly interact with Bax and Bak to catalyze oligomerizatoin/pore formation
# numerous reports have suggested that these three proteins as well as p53 transiently and dynamically bind
# Bax and Bak that leads to a stepwise series of conformational changes that lead to activation so that
# Bax and Bak can oligomerize and form pores for MOMP
# Here, several different mechanisms for each of the proteins are written in order to investigate the nature
# of these direct interactions
